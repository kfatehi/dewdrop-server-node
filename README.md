dewdrop-server-node
===================

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/dewdrop-server-node.png?mini=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/dewdrop-server-node/)

I got tired of hitting the CloudApp limit, and I [suck at deploying PHP apps](https://github.com/dewdrop-org/Server-PHP/issues/1) so I rewrote [DewDrop](http://dewdrop.dangelov.com/)'s [php server](https://github.com/dewdrop-org/Server-PHP) in Node.js

Get the clients here http://dewdrop.dangelov.com/ or if you're on Mac OS X, you can `brew cask install dewdrop`
